## Why?
I love Fastmail's masked email feature, but going to the Fastmail settings page to create a new masked email every time
I need one is cumbersome. This extension streamlines the process, allowing you to create new masked emails with just
two clicks.

This functionality comes built-in with 1Password and Bitwarden, but if you're using something else, like Chrome's
built-in password manager, this extension is for you!

## API Token
To use this extension, you'll need to generate an API token for your Fastmail account. You can do this in the [Fastmail
settings](https://app.fastmail.com/settings/security/tokens/new). I recommend creating a new token specifically for this
extension, so it's easier to revoke later if needed.

For security reasons, make sure the token **only** has the "Masked Email" scope.
